# Hi, I'm Elias 👋

I'm a backend engineer working remotely with startups.

I specialize in one specific problem:

**What happens after your SaaS launches and users start behaving unpredictably.**

Most early-stage products don't fail because of scale.
They fail because of inconsistent state, background job failures and edge-case user behavior.

I help teams:

* stabilize APIs
* debug production issues
* fix slow queries
* design sync and background processing
* prevent data inconsistencies
* make systems observable

## Current Focus

Lately I’ve been studying reliability patterns for small SaaS systems:

→ Offline-first clients
→ Retry and idempotency strategies
→ Notification pipelines
→ Auth edge cases
→ Failure recovery

You can see a practical example here:

## Experience

10+ years building and maintaining web and mobile systems.

Worked with:

* banking applications
* fintech startups
* high-traffic APIs
* real-time systems

Tech I frequently use:
Go • Node.js • PostgreSQL • Redis • Docker • Cloudflare • AWS

## If you are a founder

If your product recently launched and you’re seeing:

* random bugs users can’t reproduce
* jobs that sometimes run
* notifications not sent
* database behaving strangely

That’s usually not a coding problem.
It’s a system behavior problem.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to take a quick look.
